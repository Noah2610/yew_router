# YewRouter
A Routing library for the Yew frontend framework.

I currently don't have any intension to publish this to crates.io so as to not occupy a valuable namespace,
but it should be perfectly usable as a routing library for Yew.
You can use it in your project by adding it to your dependencies like so:
```toml
[dependencies]
yew_router = { git = "https://github.com/hgzimmerman/YewRouter" }
```
