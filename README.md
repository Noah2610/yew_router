# YewRouter
A Routing library for the Yew frontend framework.

I currently don't have any intention to publish this to crates.io so as to not occupy a valuable namespace,
but it should be perfectly usable as a routing library for Yew.
You can use it in your project by adding it to your dependencies like so:
```toml
[dependencies]
yew_router = { git = "https://github.com/hgzimmerman/YewRouter" branch="master" }
```

### Small Disclaimer
The API surface will be changing in the near future as I experiment with ways to acomplish the goal of creating an easy to use router.
